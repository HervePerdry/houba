Description: Continuation of the MMatrix private package,
    originally only a C++ library for making memory mapped templated matrix. 
    MarsuMatrix is now a fully fleshed R package, with an R interface 
    and a R class (mmatrix). Its goal is to use a file with memory mapping
    to keep its data on disk, and read it 
    as a basic Matrix (2 dims) 
    or a R-style array (with multiple dimension)
