\usage{
marray(type = c("double", "float", "int", "short"), dim, filename, readonly)

mmatrix(
  type = c("double", "float", "int", "int16_t"),
  nrow,
  ncol,
  filename,
  readonly
)

mvector(type = c("double", "float", "int"), length, filename, readonly)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{the data type}

\item{dim}{dimension of marray}

\item{filename}{(optional) path to file}

\item{readonly}{(optional) if \code{TRUE}, the object will be read-only.}

\item{nrow}{number of rows of mmatrix}

\item{ncol}{number of columns of mmatrix}

\item{length}{length of mvector}
}
\description{
These functions create memory mapped vectors, matrices or arrays, 
possibly from an existing file.
}
\details{
Currently \code{type} can only be double, float, int, or short. Short will always be a 16 bits 
integer (int16_t).

If \code{filename} is missing, a temporary filename will be generated using \code{tempfile}.
In the contrary case, is the file exists, it will be opened (if its size is compatible with the dimension
of the object); if the file does not exist, it will be created.

If \code{readonly} is missng, it will be set to \code{TRUE} when opening an existing file, and
to \code{FALSE} when the file is created by the function.
